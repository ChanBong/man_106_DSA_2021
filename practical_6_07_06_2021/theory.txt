In Order : K M I C E B D L G F H A      
Pre Order: D C I K M B E A L F G H

- First node in pre-order traversal is root node:
    => Root = D

- We'll recursively use the fact that everything on the left of the root in in-order traversal is in the left subtree and everthing
on the right is in the right subtree

- For D as a root :
    left subtree:  K M I |C| E B
                   |C| I K M B E
    right subtree: L G F H |A|
                   |A| L F G H

- For C as a root: 
    left subtree:  K M |I| 
                   |I| K M
    right subtree: E |B|
                   |B| E

- For I as a root:
    left subtree:  |K| M
                   |K| M 
    right subtree: NULL

- For K as a root;
    left subtree:  NULL
    right subtree: M

- For B as a root;
    left subtree:  E
    right subtree: NULL

    Left branch of entire tree:
              D
          C
       I      B
    K     E
      M
